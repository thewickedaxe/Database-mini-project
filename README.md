# Database-mini-project
A miniproject for CS 600.415
Uses philadelphia's indego program data to perform nosql queries

## Requirements
1. You need to have pymongo installed `sudo pip install pymongo`
2. Tested on Linux and Mac. Windows support is not guaranteed.
3. **If you are testing our project be sure to disconnect from and hopkins ssid. Hopkins blocks the mongodb network ports and you would get db conn errors. Connect to your home comcast network or a mobile hotspot**
